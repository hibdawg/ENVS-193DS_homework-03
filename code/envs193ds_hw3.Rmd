## Part 2. Problems

## Problem 1. Personal Data

# Data Summarizing

#A.  
[I could compare how the duration of events follows my class schedule and see how I have shorter events on days where I have class due to gaps in my schedule where I study. I also want to compare how total study time based on weeks increase, or may taper off as I struggle to find a spot in the library and may need to go elsewhere to study.]

#B.  
```{r Data Visualization}
ggplot(
  clean_hibdata, # Select Clean Datafram
  aes(x = day, # X axis
      fill = duration_category) # based on Category of Session Length
) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + # Bar Graph
  labs( # Add labels
    title = "Short vs Long Weekly Study Sessions 4/20/25 - 5/29/25", # title of Graph
    x = "Days of the Week", # X Label
    y = "Number of Sessions", # Y Lael
    fill = "Session Type", # Differentiate Based on category
    caption = "Study Session Data From Hibah Ganie"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + # choose theme!
  scale_fill_manual( # manually change colors 
    values = c("short" = "pink", # pink
               "long" = "#223291")) # orange
```

#C.
[Visualizing UCSB Library Study session Data by category: Long, Short, based on threshold of 1 hour and 30 minutes throughout the week. Trends in shorter, more frequent sessions are common in the beginning of the week and often end in long frequent session specifically on Sunday.]

#D.
```{r}

hibtable <- clean_hibdata |>  # making a table with my cleaned data 
  select(day, duration_category) |> #select which columns i want in my table
  tbl_summary( # choose how I want the data to be divided up in, as categorical: short and long
    by = day,
    statistic = all_categorical() ~ "{n}",
    label = list(duration_category ~ "Session Type")
  ) |> 
  bold_labels() # add a pop of boldness in my chaer

hibtable_gt <- hibtable |> # to add color i need to convert to gt table.,,,
  as_gt() |> 
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Weekly Study Session Count by Day and Type**") # new header!!
  ) |> 
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(color = "white", weight = "bold"), # add color and bold!!
    locations = cells_title(groups = "title")
  ) |> 
  tab_options(
    heading.background.color = "darkslateblue" # color!!
  )

hibtable_gt
```

## Problem 2: Affective Visualization

#A. 
[I really enjoyed the simplicity and amount of information able to be conveyed in the interface between graph lines and nature. Since my study sessions are characterized by many different aspects, I would like to do a similar concept. I want to show how the intensity of studying changes throughout the week based on my workload.]

#B.

#C
[![Draft!](data/visual.png)]

#D
[I am showing how the duration and frequency of my study sessions changes throughout the week.
The interface between graph and image was highly influenced by Jill Peltos paintings which include the slope of graphs in landscapes
I did an online drawing on a drawing app. While the online format may be easier, in my next draft I would like to use a physical medium]

## 3 Statistical Critique

#a.
[A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), was used to look at differences between
vegetation and watershed regions. The response variables are CAR, SAR, C density, organic and mineral sedimentation, with the
predictor being watershed regions.]
[![Draft!](data/stat.png)]

#b.
[The X-axis and plot itself is a bit clogged with codes, such as: CA,CT,BCD, etc, which reduce the readability of the figure. However the graph is very readable and clearly represents that standard error, mean value, and interquartile range for each figure. The figure shows summary statistics. We can see some of the underlying data in the form of raw data points.]

#C.
[Considering how many sites the author had to include, the design is decently uncluttered, however the codes clutter the plot due to the sheer amount. The data to ink ratio is high, as each element explains essiental information.]

#D.
[I thik integrating a color coding system would help alieviate some of the cluttering in the plot. They could possibly give each plot a different color/symbol and maybe put the legend outside of the plot. They could also streamline the means, as the diamonds overlap the essiential information, such as means and get lost. It could also help to group by region to declutter the plot.]
