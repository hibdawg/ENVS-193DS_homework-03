### Part 2. Problems

## Problem 1. Personal Data

# Data Summarizing

A.  
[I could compare how the duration of events follows my class schedule and see how I have shorter events on days where I have class due to gaps in my schedule where I study. I also want to compare how total study time based on weeks increase, or may taper off as I struggle to find a spot in the library and may need to go elsewhere to study.]

B.  
```{r Data Visualization}
ggplot(
  clean_hibdata, # Select Clean Datafram
  aes(x = day, # X axis
      fill = duration_category) # based on Category of Session Length
) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") + # Bar Graph
  labs( # Add labels
    title = "Short vs Long Study Sessions Throuout the Week", # title of Graph
    x = "Days of the Week", # X Label
    y = "Number of Sessions", # Y Lael
    fill = "Session Type", # Differentiate Based on category
    caption = "Study Session Data From Hibah Ganie"
  ) + 
  theme_classic() + # choose theme!
  scale_fill_manual( # mannually change colors 
    values = c("short" = "pink", # pink
               "long" = "#223291")) # orange
```
